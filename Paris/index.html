            <h2>A Weekend on the Seine</h2>
            <p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris
                this month!<br> I went with a friend and we were able to
                see many things while<br> we were there!</p>

                <h4>Day 1</h4>
                    <p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em><br>
                    right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel Tower<br> 
                    (check on that beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute<br>
                    little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>.</p>

                <h4>Day 2</h4>
                    <p>On our second day, we went shopping on venue <em>des Champs Elysees</em></emdes><br>
                       Every single person we saw was dressed in the height of fashion.<br>
                       <br>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places!<br>
                       We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of Paris and <br>
                       ate all of the best macarons the city had to offer. After we finished<br>
                       shopping, we visited <em>Louvre</em>.</p>

                <h4>Day 3</h4>
                    <p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge!<br>
                        We also went to le <em>Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of Renoir, Monet,<br>
                        and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to<br>
                        see that the museum also had many sculptures including those by<br>
                        Auguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.<br><br>
